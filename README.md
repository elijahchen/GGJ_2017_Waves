[Pitch]
A grid of blocks will be tiled across the screen. The blocks will be binary, for all purposes intent let us call them black or white blocks. There will be a queue of available squares that the user can anticipate, which will either be black, white, or modifier (Will describe further below).

Black blocks on queue can only interact with white blocks and vice versa. Upon interaction, the blocks directly adjacent (edge to edge) to the block pressed will flip into their opposite colors.

The objective of the game is to meet the winning conditions on top of the screen, as an example if the winning condition was to have a specific number of black/white blocks and the exact number of specified blocks exist on the board/playing field then the winning condition is met. The next level will trigger after a short message of reward is presented to the user. There is no losing condition, only a reset option/modifier.

The idea of the game is to have a causual experience with little punishment, this is ideal for a simple distraction/low stress. A competitive player can still enjoy the game at higher levels.
